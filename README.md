> RoboEagles 2025 [Reefscape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reefscape_(FIRST)) Robot

## Contains
- [x] Docker container with preinstalled dependencies
- [x] Phoenix6 Autogenerated RIO Swerve Code
- [ ] 2025 Reefscape RIO Code
- [ ] ROS Jazzy with Robot URDF
- [ ] NetworkTables <==> ROS Bridge
- [ ] Gazebo Simulator that integrates ROS for full simulation 

## Setup Instructions
This project was built on Ubuntu and Linux Mint, but should work on any Linux distribution.

1. Make sure you have Git and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed
2. Clone the project with `git clone https://github.com/RoboEagles4828/phyto2025.git`
3. Enter the repository and install needed dependencies with `sudo bash ./scripts/local-setup.sh`
    - When the program asks for a ROS_NAMESPACE, enter a short and distinct name that can be identified as you
4. Install the [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension in VSCode
5. Check that everything is installed and setup
    - You should have ssh keys in `~/.ssh`
    - Docker CLI should be installed and runnable
    - VSCode should be set up with Dev Containers
6. Run the command "Rebuild and Reopen in Container" in VSCode
    - (This will likely take a while to download the docker container)
7. Congratulations! If the container opened without failing, you should now have a working setup!

## Using the Simulator

### Prerequisites
- Dev Container is installed
- Project is built with <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd>
- Xbox Controller is connected for drive

Gazebo Harmonic is installed in the container by default, so all `gz` commands should work

Run `launch gazebo` in the container to start RIO code, bridges, and the simulator.
